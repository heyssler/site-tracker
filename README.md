# Site Time-Tracker


### TODO

Bugs:
  1. If debug mode is not on, setInterval is limited to 30s

Features:
  1. Track data on "inactive" tabs (?)
     - Maybe track every active tab on each window? Or tabs that play sound in the background?
  3. Include graphs and other visual data components
  4. Daily, Weekly, Monthly updates
  5. 'More Data' option to see more than 10 entries at a time
